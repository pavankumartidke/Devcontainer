## Let's deep dive in DevContainer setup

### Run exiisting project with devcontainer

1. Clone project in desired location and open folder in vscode
   ```
   [/mnt/{drive}/path/to/project]$ code .
   ```
   e.g. `/mnt/c/My_Projects/project-1`
2. After opening vscode, go ahead and press `f1` or `ctrl + shift + P` to open vscode's command palette.

3. Now, type `Dev Container: Rebuild amd Reopen in container` in that command palette and hit `enter`

4. Now, devcontainer building process is begin, it may ask for WSL password, so keep an eye on the logs. (To see logs, below notification area click on `(show logs)`)

5. Wait for some time until you see the starting the terminal of `backend` or `frontend` depending on what you have started.

## Customizations in devcontainer

- If you want to add vscode extensions or your preffered settings, then you can modify it according to you :

  - Open `.devcontainer` folder, (Located in project's root dir)
  - Edit `devcontainer.json` file

    ```
    "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
          "extensions": [
             ...
          ],
          "settings": {
             ...,

             "files.watcherExclude": {
                ...
             }
          }
       }
